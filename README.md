#Parking Lot Finder
Parking Lot finder is a Django web app to list and locate parking lots according to the location of need.

##General info
Parking Lot finder is a web app for locating the nearby parking lots which have been built with Django and python for my semester 8 project. This web app has been designed in such a way that it consists of actors such as user, employee and admin. And a user can locate a nearby parking lot or if he owns one, he can list the parking lot in the app and earn a decent passive income.
